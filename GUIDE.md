# User Guide

This is a user guide for the Reddit bot. If you are a developer, try README.md instead.

## Using Commands

All commands you want to execute must be prefixed by the bot's mention, i.e. u/RedditEco. Other messages will be ignored even if edited to include the prefix.

## Currency

The currency of u/RedditEco is called the nirvan (plural: nirvanes), as a play on karma. The symbol, which is shown in the bot's responses, is `Â¤`. You start with 2000 nirvanes by registering an account.

## Making an Account

By making an account, you agree to your Reddit data being stored in our databases indefinitely. Account deletion is not possible at the time of writing.

> u/RedditEco register

This will create an account for you if you do not already have one, with a default of 2000 nirvanes.

## Payment

You can pay a user by responding to their comment with the `pay` command:

> u/RedditEco pay 5000
